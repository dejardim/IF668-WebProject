# IF668 Web Project

IF668 Web Project is my personal website and portfolio. It is hosting on my domain at cin.ufpe.br/~mvas2 to be like a door opened to see which my interests and what I do. It began as a simple retro pixelart website built with HTML/CSS and by now the website mix modern layouts with mono fonts and pixel arts.

IF668 Web Project is responsive, but doesn't enforce any dependencies, just use HTML and CSS.
